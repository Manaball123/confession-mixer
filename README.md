# confession-mixer
 probably the dumbest idea ive ever had 

<sup><sub>this is what happens when you watch too many dumb romcoms kids....</sub></sup> 

# I. what the fuck is this??? 
 As seen in many romcom anime which are obviously very real depictions of real life, people often suffer from several issues surrounding love confessions: 

## i. 2 scared 2 confess
 The innate fear of confession comes from the fear of rejection. Confession is often seen as the exposure of vulnerability(whether that really is the case is left
 for an exercise for the reader), as such, getting rejected after confessing would be something akin to having some person stab you after you exposed your heart to 
 them or some shit like that, which probably isnt the best feeling. 

## ii. skewed evaluation
 When the other party is made aware of the confession, their assessment of the situation is often less objective than usual(i.e. they "feel bad for rejecting").
 The obvious issue of this is that the 2 parties end of together anyway despite the lack of reciprocating feelings, and it is only a matter of time before it
 crumbles and falls apart(like how the twin towers fell apart on 2001/09/11).  

## iii. disturbance of the status quo
 Not only would rejection often hurt the confessor's feelings(boohoo), it also could disturub the current friendship one might have established. People 
 often feel inclined to keep things in the status quo even if it means possibly missing out on some better stuff(source: my teen romantic comedy). 
 A disturbance of this state is not only relevant to the 2 parties, but it has(often negative) externalities as well. For instance, if both parties
 are present in a friend group and one of them got rejected, then it would be sort of awkward to still be together after this, and the friend group
 would at the very least lose a significant member, assuming it doesn't fall apart entirely. 

## iv. this thing 
...and this is precisely why this software is a thing(could barely call it software but ehhh) 
this thing pools together confession and only makes it known to both parties only if the feeling is mutual, thus alleviating the 3 aforementioned issues: 
1. hurts slightly less when the other person didnt even say the rejection to ur face 
2. other party is unaware of the confession 
3. no one is even aware of it except the confessor, if it didnt go through 

the app itself is pretty straightforward so im not even gonna bother explaining how to use 

# II. why it sucks 
## i. missed the point 
 even though getting rejected sucks and stuff it will like enrich your life experience, and this one sort of takes that away 
## ii. oversimplification of romance 
 sometimes people arent even aware of the romantic feelings they harbor so they might not even acknowledges it until some person asks them out or something 
## iii. feels cheap 
 lets be honest here no ones gonna just give up their love interest because computer told them no 

# III. todo
## i. weighted system
 as of now the selection system is binary, that is, you are only able to select one person that you like, but in reality one might have multiple interests with 
 diferent attributed weighs to them, which might help one find a partner even if their number 1 choice denies them. However figuring out an algo that is fair 
 to everyone is kinda hard and idk how to do it
## ii. webapp 
 if people are actually gonna use this, they most definitely wont compile a rust app every time they do, so a webapp should probably be made to make this at least
 somewhat usuable


# IV. other stuff 
## why does code suck? 
this is like the first time ive written anything in rust please dont flame me 
## why rust? 
can port into web app eventually with webasm(lets be honest thats not happening) 
also learn fun language, which apparently isnt that fun after all after ive actually learned about it
